Flower image classifier

In this project, I will train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. I had trained this classifier and exported it for use in application.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

1. Load and preprocess the image dataset
2. Train the image classifier on your dataset
3. Use the trained classifier to predict image content
